## Overview

Thrust is the force generated by rocket engines that propels spacecraft forward. It is calculated as the product of mass flow rate and exhaust velocity. Accurate thrust calculation is essential for engine performance analysis and mission planning.

## Background

- **Thrust (F):** The force exerted by expelled mass, measured in Newtons (N).  
- **Mass Flow Rate (\( \dot{m} \)):** Amount of propellant mass expelled per second (kg/s).  
- **Exhaust Velocity (\( v_e \)):** Speed of propellant gases exiting the engine (m/s).  

The thrust equation is:  
\[
F = \dot{m} \times v_e
\]

## How It Works

1. The user inputs:  
   - Mass flow rate (kg/s)  
   - Exhaust velocity (m/s)  

2. The calculator multiplies these inputs to compute thrust in Newtons.

3. The thrust value is displayed to the user.

## Usage

Run the script with Python 3:

```bash
python thrust_calculator.py
